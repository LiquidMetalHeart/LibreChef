# LibreChef

LibreChef is an open source AI kitchen assistant platform. It aims to provide a customizable and user-friendly tool that can automatically generate recipes based on available ingredients, dietary preferences, and user-defined parameters, as well as automate online grocery shopping.

## Why LibreChef?

As AI technology becomes more advanced and more prevalent in our daily lives, we believe there's an opportunity for the open source community to create a powerful, versatile, and privacy-centric alternative to proprietary AI kitchen assistants. LibreChef aims to fill this gap.

## Feature Goals

- Recipe Generation: Leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 API to generate recipes based on the ingredients available in your kitchen.
- Smart Shopping List: Automatically generates a shopping list based on the ingredients required for generated recipes.
- Fully Customisable Preferences: Allows users to define their dietary preferences and needs.
- Modularity: Ability to use open-source LLMs as an alternative to GPT-4 for recipe generation.
- Interoperability: Compatible with a range of existing platforms, IoT devices and smart home systems. 
- Hardware (long term): Smart sensor containers that can be added to an existing kitchen environment and automatically detect ingredients to feed data to LibreChef without manual user entry.
